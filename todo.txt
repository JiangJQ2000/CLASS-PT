non-linear module affects lensing.c, lensing.h, transfers, spectra and output
I should make a hybrid method where one is able to choose between different methods.

TODO: 

1) Understand the wrapper !

Shit: it complains about the gsl library. I have to implement the splines myself

3) write all the FFTLog parameters in the parameter module and call them from there

They are stored in input.c in the structure 
'int input_default_precision'

and their types (int, double) are defined in common.h

4) Add all the bias power spectra. Better define a new function like spectra_pk_nl_at_z() 
which would contain all the bias power spectra. 
(Othwerwise it's messy with the 'pk_nl.dat' function) 

5) Do indexing like 'k_ffltog_index'
