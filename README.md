# CLASS-PT

This is a modification of the CLASS code that computes the non-linear power spectra of dark matter and biased tracers in one-loop cosmological perurbation theory. See `instructions.pdf' for the installation details.  Check the code paper for more information.  

Check out the jupyter notebook 'notebooks/nonlinear_pt.ipynb' for the examples of working sessions. 

You can also use the Mathematica notebook 'read_tables.nb' to read the code output.
