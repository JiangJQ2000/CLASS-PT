# CLASS-PT

This is a modification of the CLASS code that computes the non-linear power spectrum of dark matter and biased tracers in perurbation theory. See `instructions.pdf' for the installation details. The details can be found in the code paper.  

Check out the jupyter notebook 'notebooks/nonlinear_pt.ipynb' for the examples of working sessions. 
You can also use the Mathematica notebook 'read_tables.nb' to read the code output.
