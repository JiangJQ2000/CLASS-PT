# CLASS-PT: nonlinear perturbation theory extension of the Boltzmann code CLASS

Authors: Mikhail (Misha) Ivanov and Anton Chudaykin 

with major inputs from other people, especially Marko Simonovic

This is a modification of the CLASS code that computes the non-linear power spectra of dark matter and biased tracers in one-loop cosmological perurbation theory.
 
# Getting started

See `instructions.pdf' for the installation details.  

The installation instuctions for CLASS can be found on the official code webpage https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public

Check out the jupyter notebook 'notebooks/nonlinear_pt.ipynb' for the examples of working sessions.

You can also use the Mathematica notebook 'read_tables.nb' to read the code output.

# Using the code

You can use CLASS-PT freely, provided that in your publications you cite at least the code paper. Feel free to cite the other companion papers devoted to new large-scale structure analysis methodologies!
